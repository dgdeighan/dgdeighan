<h2>Hi!</h2> 
<br>I'm David Deighan. I'm a self-taught programmer with proficient experience developing web apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a good amount of experience with front-end UI frameworks like React and Vue.
<br>
<br>I'm very interested in becoming a front-end web developer, and I'm interested in learning more about back-end web development for the purposes of further strengthening my skills and expertise with JavaScript, I am also interested in game development, since games are a big personal passion of mine.
